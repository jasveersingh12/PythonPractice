Questions: find the greatest no 
Answer:
a1 = int(input("enter your number 1 : "))
a2 = int(input("enter your number 2 : "))
a3 = int(input("enter your number 3 : "))
a4 = int(input("enter your number 4 : "))

if (a1>a2 and a1>a3 and a1>a4):
    print("greatest number is a1", a1)
if (a2>a1 and a2>a3 and a2>a4):
    print("greatest number is a2", a2)
if (a3>a2 and a3>a1 and a3>a4):
    print("greatest number is a3", a3)
if (a4>a2 and a4>a3 and a4>a1):
    print("greatest number is a4", a4)

 Question : find the percentage of student and tell them they are pass or fail with percentage how much they get
Answer :
a1 = int(input("enter you marks1 :"))
a2 = int(input("enter you marks2 :"))

total_percentage =(a1 + a2 + a3)/300*100

if(total_percentage >= 40 and a1>= 33 and a2>= 33, a3>= 33):
    print("you are pass ", total_percentage)

else:
